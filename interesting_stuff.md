Here is a list of interesting stuff I did :)

## Modding

## Graphics Programming
 - [Flatova(OpenGL game engine written in C99, with Entity-Component-System)](https://github.com/AMAIOLAMO/flatova-opengl)
 - [Terminal Raymarcher(A graphical terminal based renderer)](https://github.com/AMAIOLAMO/tmarcher)
    - written to support kitty terminal mainly, as long as your terminal supports [ansi escape codes for colors(hopefully full range)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).
    - utilizes pure unix socket programming, can do local multiplayer :) (though a bit buggy and incomplete, but it works).
    - parallel and pure CPU rendering.

 - [Discrete Fourier Transform Drawer](https://github.com/AMAIOLAMO/C-DFTEpicircles)
    - Converts points into epicircles and draw them on the screen (inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) introduction of 3Blue1Brown for fourier transforms)
