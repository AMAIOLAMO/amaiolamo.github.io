title: Value Modifiers
---

Today I had an idea on which we could register multiple modifiers to change a single base value.

I called it: Value Modifiers

here's the repository to it: [Value Modifiers](https://github.com/AMAIOLAMO/Value-Modifiers-CSharp)

I was inspired by the modifiers from Blender, each object / mesh contains multiple modifiers
that modifies the original mesh in some way, but does not destroys the original mesh.

Currently my Value Modifiers doesn't use lists, but dictionaries instead, which
isn't a good idea when what we wanted is actually apply the modification in order.

will update that soon, but until then

Cheers :D
