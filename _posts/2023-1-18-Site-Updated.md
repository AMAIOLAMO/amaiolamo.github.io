Was playing with jekyll lately and I have to say it's quite an interesting journey so far!

I have managed to make this blog into a dracula theme by changing the `style.scss`

hopefully it's now better with less eye strain :)

Although I still have yet to figure out the footer you can see below the site.

For now all is good enough.

Cheers.
