Hello! This is my learning compendium / handbook. It serves as a heuristic guideline on what to do given a certain situation when you are learning.

Do note that this handbook does not go deep on how learning itself works, but rather gives you ideas (that are 'hopefully' and mostly proven by science) that you can try it out! Since everyone has different kinds of learning skill.

You can start directly by answering this simple [[Troubleshoot Questionaire|Questionnaire]]!
