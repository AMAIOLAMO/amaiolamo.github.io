title: Knowledge, Information, Learning And Memorizing (YJango)
---

One day, I was studying learning and memorization, and was curious about what's the strict difference between learning and memorizing. Is memorizing some information learning? Or is it entirely different?


That thought plagued me until I found out about YJango (a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from China), they have sent a series of videos on the chinese video streaming website [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/344849038), which explains the "learning theory" he derived from "Machine Learning" in Computer Science.

One of the idea that stuck with me is this:
学习 不是 记忆 (learning is not memorization)
知识 不是 信息 (knowledge is not information)

So this part of learning handbook will be dedicated to some of his "learning theory" that was derived directly from "Machine learning theory".

#### Learning and Memorization
> **Learning** is the act of internalizing some rule into the mind, so that you can solve future "unknown problems", albeit not entirely accurate to reality.


Examples:
1. You learnt a new theorem in mathematics, you not only remembered the formula, but also understood what every part of it means, or at least what form of the equation it needs to feel like. Then you proceeded to use it in a new problem that you have never seen before.
2. You studied a new technique in planting plants, you decided to use it in a new plant you bought home.

> **Memorization** is the act of storing static knowledge, so that you can recall the same knowledge in the future.


Examples:
1. Your history teacher taught a new topic about a historical event, you decided to memorize the historical year associated with events during that time, and during the exam, you recalled it and wrote exactly that.
2. You recalled in the past, you have seen this animal before, and you decided to explain your experienced during that time to a friend.


> NOTE:
> Both *Memorization* and *Learning* are important, best case scenario is balance both depending on the thing you are learning.


#### Knowledge and Information
> **Knowledge** is the association of some input to some output. In otherwords, it allows you to have some information and use this information to predict some other thing.

Examples:
1. The sun always rises everyday. (input is date, output is whether or not sun rises)
