#### Constant Reflection
![](/images/expressions/think_question.png)
- Constant reflection after practice and theoretical study. 
- Write down what you feel confused, and what you don't know. Really. **WRITE IT DOWN**. knowledge is intricate, and it's easy to overlook the more smallest detail, when in fact, those smallest detail are the most important ones / the ones you are missing.

Utilizing the things you wrote down during your reflection, plan for your next action.

#### Measure Performance

  1. Self tests: Self testing refers to the act of giving yourself a... well test. It could be in a form of written test, or an actual test by applying something you have never done before.

  2. Collect Information: There are many ways to collect information related to your ability to learn. Being able to measure your efficiency in learning is quite important.
  Let's say you are an artist, how do you collect information on whether or not you are improving? Well, one way is to upload this to social media, utilizing the "like" and "comments" to collect information regarding your ability to draw! (albeit a bit biased).

  Another example would be to try to teach someone (similar to feynmann's method), when you teach someone the thing you are learning, especially when the other really has no idea what the subject it is about, you will quickly see what are the things you may miss, and what you can improve upon in your undestanding. Rinse and repeat.

#### What to do When Stuck?
Incubation period: Do something else, maybe your current knowledge is not sufficient enough for you to fully get the entire thing. Or maybe your mind is too LAZER focused on one area, and actually missed out the actual solution. Take a break, REALLY put your mind off, and STOP thinking about it for a while.
