#### Constant Reflection
![](/images/expressions/think_question.png)
- Constant reflection after practice and theoretical study. 
- Write down what you feel confused, and what you don't know. Really. **WRITE IT DOWN**. knowledge is intricate, and it's easy to overlook the more smallest detail, when in fact, those smallest detail are the most important ones / the ones you are missing.

Utilizing the things you wrote down during your reflection, plan for your next action.

#### Measure Performance

  1. Self tests: forced recall

#### When stuck
Incubation period: Do smth else, maybe ur current knowledge is not sufficient enough for you to fully get the entire thing. Or maybe your mind is too LAZER focused on one area, and actually missed out the actual solution. Take a break, REALLY put ur mind off, and STOP thinking about it for a while.
