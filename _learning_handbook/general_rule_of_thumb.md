title: General Rule Of Thumb
---

This page serves as a collection of heuristic guidelines that helps you through your learning endeavours.

#### *5/95 rule*
- 5% of time for theoretical knowledge, 95% of time for practice

#### *Self testing*
![](/images/expressions/test.png)
- If you cant solve the same problem twice, u don't know it well enough.
- Giving self test is actually a useful measurement for what you actually know.
Instead of being tricked by the [illusion](/learning_handbook/mental_misconceptions) your ego and your brain gives you.

#### *Feynmann's method*
![](/images/expressions/talk.png)
- If you cant explain it simply to someone else with no prior knowledge, you don't know it well enough.

#### *Be brave*
![](/images/expressions/happi.png)
- brave enough to embrace that you suck. Embrace the shit that you have to get through, embrace the people who might judge you for it.

#### *Active Recall*
![](/images/expressions/think_hard.png)
- *Recall* is extremely important, you don't learn through just cheesing and lying to yourself, you have to make yourself feel pain, take time to really recall. Often do self tests as an actual way of measuring your current skill and knowledge.
- Active recall is different than Passive recall, active is that you "force" your knowledge to be pulled out your brain, even if it's not easy.

#### *Manage your Energy*
![](/images/expressions/think_question.png)
- Your brain works similarly to exercise when you are working hard, your "internal fuel" decreases. The longer you work, the less fuel you have, hence your efficiency decreases a lot. To "refuel", go take a break! They are often under valued. Work in BURSTS, and don't drag your mind endlessly like doom scrolling :).

#### *Creative thinking*
- Creativity is important in problem solving as well as real life solutions. Think out of the box, do something different than others. Choose this when needed.
- Try to IGNORE taboos, rules, and go out your way like a delinquent! (But don't really actually do the things delinquents do :P, rather think outside the regular boundaries)

#### *Knowledge Links*
![](/images/embeds/knowledge_links.png)
- Create associations between knowledge, topics, or even areas of interests can give you new insight of the same topic, and deepen your skills towards both. It also has a side effect of making you remember it better! Link to something that you know from your past, link to your childhood, link from mathematics to eating pizza, link from a new hard topic to a joke! Whatever you can think of, as long as it makes sense to you.
- memorization techniques often utilize the idea of knowledge links, things like memory palace forces you to link using spacial memory: putting items as association of knowledge in a familiar place.


- A pretty common examples are people's names. It is pretty often we forget a newly met person's name. So a tried and true technique would be to 
associate their name with their appearance. For example, bob has a long wavy hair, so we can just say that his hair "bobs around like a bubble".
This creates association between something that is intangible (names) into something that is tangible (appearances).

#### *If You Don't Understand Theoretically, Find Concrete Examples Instead*
- Sometimes, you have something that is very abstract in a way that makes no sense to you when you look at it.
So instead, it is best to find an example of the thing and start from there! Instead of going from general to specific, you go from specific examples to a more general conclusion :)


#### *Learning is Controlled Suffering*
- There is no real "short-cut" in learning, in the end, we are hard-wired to feel "pain" when we start to learn.
Sometimes we get curious and that beats the pain we felt when we learn. Hence, learning is actually a choice to suffer,
to exchange for improvement.

- Learning how to "suffer" when needed, and "stop suffering" when not needed is extremely important.
You don't want to sit there learning for something you don't really need or you don't really want, right?


#### *Spaced Repetition*
![](/images/embeds/time_retention_spaced_repetition_graph.png)
- If you try to recall something, try to interleave time between (half a day / 1 ~ 3 days), enough for you to forget some parts of the thing.
So that next time when you recall, it would be "legit" and "actually hard" and not just repetition. Do this multiple times with the help of knowledge links,
and you will have this thing "printed" in your mind.

- Think of each memorization as a percentage, instead of memorizing 100% all the time.
Each time you remember 100%, you forget 90%, but if you, recall them over 10 times, you can basically remember majority / all of the content over a very long period of time!

- Techniques such as Flash Cards utilize this fact.


#### *Harder to Recall Now = Better Memory In The Future*
- Sounds counter intuitive, but according to science, Active Recall makes your brain actually activate PAIN signals (no joke, I'm serious),
and you see, if we try so hard and take a long time in recalling something, it actually makes recalling it easier in the future.

- An example of this is that you got into a severe car crash, is that easy to forget? NO! It affected you so much that your brain literally memorized the situation so 
to prevent you don't get into the same situation next time. Though not necessarily "harder to recall" per se.

- This pairs better with the fact that the ["Forgetting Curve"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) approximates how a person usually forgets information over time.
So combined with Spaced Repetition, this allows things to be remembered for much longer.


#### *Divide and Conquer: Simplify Topics*
![](/images/embeds/recursion.png)
- Sometimes a topic looks very hard to chew, for example: learning an entire mathematical theory sounds like it would take years to master.
But if you think in terms of studying the basics, it's way easier. We can of course, split it further, only learn the first concept of the basics.


- You see, your ego feels way better when the thing is tiny. It is entirely natural for a person to feel overwhelmed when tasked a very big thing.
Instead, one should try to divide and split the problems, many many many times, until you can chew those tiny bits easily!



#### *Scientifically Observe and Experiment with your Learning*
- This goes without saying, learning itself is very complicated as everyone has their own way of learning.
There is no "one-fit-for-all" solution, hence be your own scientist!
Try things out; Measure your efficiency; Observe your mental & physical state before, during and after learning;



#### *Learn How To Ask*
![](/images/expressions/think_question.png)
- Asking is actually a very crucial but underrated skill. It not only helps build connections and leave better impressions(see research [here](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Huang%20et%20al%202017_6945bc5e-3b3e-4c0a-addd-254c9e603c60.pdf)), 
but can actually be extremely useful if asked the right question.
Each question asked is a potential new perspective opened to you(granted that you are willing to listen to such perspective),
some intricate idea you have never thought of, or that "click" in your mind that you have been searching for in a long time.
