title: General Rule Of Thumb

#### *5/95 rule*
- 5% of time for theoretical knowledge, 95% of time for practice

#### *Practice test*

- If you cant solve the same problem twice, u don't know it well enough.

#### *Feynmann's method*
![](/images/expressions/talk.png)
- If you cant explain it simply to someone else with no prior knowledge, you don't know it well enough.

#### *Be brave*

- brave enough to embrace that you suck. Embrace the shit that you have to get through, embrace the people who might judge you for it.

#### Active Recall

- *Recall* is extremely important, you don't learn through just cheesing and lying to yourself, you have to make yourself feel pain, take time to really recall. Often do self tests as an actual way of measuring your current skill and knowledge.
- Active recall is different than Passive recall, active is that you "force" your knowledge to be pulled out your brain, even if it's not easy.

#### Manage your Energy

- Your brain works similarly to exercise when you are working hard, your "internal fuel" decreases. The longer you work, the less fuel you have, hence your efficiency decreases a lot. To "refuel", go take a break! They are often under valued. Work in BURSTS, and don't drag your mind endlessly like doom scrolling :).

#### Creative thinking
- Creativity is important in problem solving as well as real life solutions. Think out of the box, do something different than others. Choose this when needed.
- Try to IGNORE taboos, rules, and go out your way like a delinquent! (But don't really actually do the things delinquents do :P, rather think outside the regular boundaries)

#### Knowledge Links
- Create associations between knowledge, topics, or even areas of interests can give you new insight of the same topic, and deepen your skills towards both. It also has a side effect of making you remember it better! Link to something that you know from your past, link to your childhood, link from mathematics to eating pizza, link from a new hard topic to a joke! Whatever you can think of, as long as it makes sense to you.
- memorization techniques often utilize the idea of knowledge links, things like memory palace forces you to link using spacial memory: putting items as association of knowledge in a familiar place.
