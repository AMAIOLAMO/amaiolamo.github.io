title: General Rule Of Thumb
---

#### *5/95 rule*
- 5% of time for theoretical knowledge, 95% of time for practice

#### *Practice test*

- If you cant solve the same problem twice, u don't know it well enough.

#### *Feynmann's method*
![](/images/expressions/talk.png)
- If you cant explain it simply to someone else with no prior knowledge, you don't know it well enough.

#### *Be brave*

- brave enough to embrace that you suck. Embrace the shit that you have to get through, embrace the people who might judge you for it.

#### Active Recall

- *Recall* is extremely important, you don't learn through just cheesing and lying to yourself, you have to make yourself feel pain, take time to really recall. Often do self tests as an actual way of measuring your current skill and knowledge.
- Active recall is different than Passive recall, active is that you "force" your knowledge to be pulled out your brain, even if it's not easy.

#### Differentiate between Memorization and Learning
  - *Learning* is the act of internalizing some rule into the mind, so that you can solve future "unknown problems". Such as theorems in math.

  - *Memorization* is the act of storing static knowledge, so that you can recall the same knowledge in the future. Such as historical year associated with events during that time.


> [!NOTE] Use Both
> Both *Memorization* and *Learning* are important, best case scenario is balance both depending on the thing you are learning.

#### Creative thinking
- Creativity is important in problem solving as well as real life solutions. Think out of the box, do something different than others. Choose this when needed.

#### Knowledge Links
- Create associations between knowledge, topics, or even areas of interests can give you new insight of the same topic, and deepen your skills towards both. It also has a side effect of making you remember it better! Link to smth that you know from your past, link to your childhood, link from mathematics to eating pizza, link from a new hard topic to a joke! Whatever you can think of, as long as it makes sense to you.
