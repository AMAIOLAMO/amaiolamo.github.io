This page shares a collection of techniques that may serve useful for your learning endeavours.
Majority of the things here will be categorized based on the "major" use of the technique.


NOTE: Certain techniques actually can be used in multiple different areas, so take the categories themselves as a grain of salt :P.
Just focus on the technique themselves :D.
