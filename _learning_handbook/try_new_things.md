title: Try New Things
---


> The main purpose of trying new things is to stop boredom, burnout and to push discovery with curiosity. It is really easy to do something repetitively, such as rote reading or playing the same grinding game for who knows how long. It all gets boring one day, so switch up new things!

#### New Things, as in New Topics
Let's pick my major for example: Computer Science. It is quite easy to focus on one topic only, such as Low Level Systems assembly programming. So to pick a new topic, simply just learn about something different entirely, what about learning Graphics Programming, what about Music Programming, what about programming for businesses, or medical fields! Why not use your skill in creating tools you use everyday? What about modding for games? Or maybe you are interested in Game / App / Web / Mobile Development?

Do not be afraid of trying new topics, one of the common arguments towards this idea is: "I don't want to be a jack-of-all-trades, I wanna focus on one thing only.". But this is also a problem! More common than not, your view turns limited, I am not saying that you should learn everything at once and at a deep level, but rather trying new things breeds new ideas! After all, creativity is extremely important in problem solving, and in learning :)
