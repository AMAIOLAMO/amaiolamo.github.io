title: Time & Task Management
---

Time management is a crucial factor on whether or not you are efficient at learning.
This ties extremely close to task management where you plan a task with a specified time frame and expecting it to be complete during that time frame.


Though, the more I research and play with time & task management tools, the more I realize how "useless" todo lists can be in a daily manner.
It is entirely possible you planned to do A, B, C three things in the morning, and througout your day, majority of the actual planned things change, swap order, or gets ignored entirely.

A lot of these time & task management systems lack the ability to follow chaos, you cannot really predict every single future and expect everything to be done at the end of the day. ( At least that's how I feel :) )


#### Pomodoro Timer Technique

Pomodoro is a word that represents "Tomato", usually you will see these timers in kitchen. They act as a 1 time use timer that helps ensure you cook at an accurate time, not too long and not too short.

Pomodoro timer works in what majority will call them as "intervals", with each interval you seriously work for 25 minutes, and take short breaks (usually around 5 minutes) at the end. There are many tools online to help facilitate you in using this. One example is [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/).

The issue with Pomodoro is the definition of work and breaks, and that it expects you to be able to follow the timing in the first place.
It is very easy to just slap some random work and take breaks while doom scrolling your favourite youtuber, social media, or play games even. Hence it is important to identify internal and external distractions according to the creator of pomodoro timer.

Another thing of note, when taking breaks during pomodoro, it is important you don't move yourself into another brain intensive "work". Things such as scrolling your phone and playing games. Instead, opt to go out and breathe some fresh air. In Gamer's words -> Go Touch Grass.
