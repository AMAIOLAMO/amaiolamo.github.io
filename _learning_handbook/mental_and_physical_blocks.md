#### Feasibility Bias Control
- Learn how to control your Feasibility bias(where you devalue ur current achievements and focus on the next goal), too less means overconfident / cocky. Too much means no happiness, no enjoyment.

- Create feasible goals, don't mentally goal creep(scope creep). Similar to controlling Feasibility Bias.

#### Rest.
Take breaks, get good sleep, eat well, don't compare with others, exercise, hydrate often, and have fun, chat with people. Life is not all about improvement and performance only.

Communicate: with others if u really need help, learn to accept and see other's perspective of the same concept.

Prevent Burnout: Stop when tired, when bored. It's easy to feel bored on the same topic over and over again. Do something else.

Prevent Bored-out: Stop when it starts to feel repetitive, try to make it interesting if you want to continue, put something new, something slightly different to make it engaging. Or just increase difficulty.

#### Executive Functions
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions),
> "executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes that support goal-directed behavior, by regulating thoughts and actions through cognitive control, selecting and successfully monitoring actions that facilitate the attainment of chosen objectives."
