title: Science And Learning
---

If you look to the basic foundation of science, it's surprisingly close to how learning works.
Gaining knowledge through experimentation is what science all about, even philosophy utilizes thought experiments to create meaningful debates.

The famous theoretical physicist Richard Feynmann had a very basic explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIxvQMhttq4) on youtube about the process of science.

#### Science's Roots in Experimentation

Feynmann wrote the following thing onto the blackboard:
1. Guess
2. Compute the consequences ( of the guess, and see what it would imply )
3. Compare the experiment ( to see if it could work )

And you see, this simple process is at the heart and root of everything science has today. If you ought to look closer in this process,
you only have a few possibilities (assuming that your experimentation process is correct):
1. Correct
2. Incorrect

And by that, you gained knowledge through comparison. You know the guess is wrong if the experiment went wrong, you know the guess is right if the experiment went as expected.
(Of course under the assumption your experiment itself actually can test the guess in the first place).

That is knowledge, and fascinatingly, scientists managed to create a process where both success and failure gains knowledge!


That is exactly how learning works as well, you have an educated guess -> try it out -> compare your guess with the result. You have now completed an experiment and no matter what, you gained some bits of knowledge.

Of course, there are still situations where you have: [False positives(incorrectly right), and false negatives(incorrectly wrong)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives) which just means your experiment is lacking something that can actually "test" your guess :)
