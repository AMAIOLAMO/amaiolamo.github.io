#### Illusion of Improvement
- It's easy to feel like you learnt something when you focus a lot of your time into doing it, for example, reading a book over and over again, hoping that you'll understand; Perhaps trying to solve one type of math problem in hopes that you can understand other ones. But this all goes down the drain when a test appears(either self test / real test), you, in fact, may not really know the thing well enough. Your brain may feel like you are starting to understand, but when you are forced to "recall" and think in a "different way", you might panic and get confused. This is your brain lying to you, making you feel like you know something when in fact you don't.

- To solve this, is exactly making yourself feel pain. By forcing yourself to test over and over again in different ways. Solving math? Sure! Grab a few pieces of problems that you haven't seen before and try to solve it. Learning swimming? Okay~ Go out and actually swim, try in a small puddle, a small pool, and try in a bigger place, and even beside the beach(don't go too far though...)! By really self-test, it breaks the illusion that your brain is telling you.

#### Visual, Verbal and Hands-on Learners
- Research[^1] suggests, the idea of "learning-styles" has technically not been proven / dis-proven. So don't try to limit yourself to one kind of learning style! Try everything at the same time :)
